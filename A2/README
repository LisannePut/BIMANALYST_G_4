# Fire Evacuation Route Analysis in BIM

## Claim Description
A building must provide a safe and efficient fire evacuation route in accordance with BR18 requirements. This route depends on several interconnected elements — such as corridors, doors, and stairs — that together enable occupants to reach safety. To assess these elements, and especially to define corridor spaces, they should be represented within a BIM model using code that identifies parameters like width, length, and connectivity between spaces.

## Justification for Selecting This Claim
This claim is suitable because BR18 specifies measurable requirements for evacuation elements including corridors, doors, and stairs. By focusing on corridors while considering their links to other spaces, we can translate these regulatory conditions into automated BIM checks. This approach aims to develop code capable of automatically identifying corridors within a BIM model.
